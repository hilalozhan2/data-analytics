As of a few days ago, she began threatening suicide. I have tirelessly spent these paat few days talking her out of it and she keeps hesitating because she wants to believe I'll come back. I know a lot of people will threaten this in order to get their way, but what happens if she really does? What do I do and how am I supposed to handle her death on my hands?

Through these past years thoughts of suicide, fear, anxiety I’m so close to my limit . I’ve been quiet for so long and I’m too scared to come out to my family about these feelings. About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful.

I just feel like there is nothing and nowhere for me. All i can feel is either nothing or unbearably sad. Im ignoring friends every opitunity i can. I feel like im loosing my girlfriend. I only hurt everyone i talk too and i dont cause anything good. Im behind on my education, i feel alone but for the first time its not a feeling ive enjoyed. I have no hopes or dreams. I care about nothing, not family, not friends, not even my girlfriend (i still love her, its complicated and i dont have the words to describe it).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |NULL                                                                                                                                                                               |0    |[honetly, idkı, dont, know, what, im, even, doing, here., ı, just, feel, like, there, is, nothing, and, nowhere, for, me., all, i, can, feel, is, either, nothing, or, unbearably, sad., ım, ignoring, friends, every, opitunity, i, can., ı, feel, like, im, loosing, my, girlfriend., ı, only, hurt, everyone, i, talk, too, and, i, dont, cause, anything, good., ım, behind, on, my, education,, i, feel, alone, but, for, the, first, time, its, not, a, feeling, ive, enjoyed., ı, have, no, hopes, or, dreams., ı, care, about, nothing,, not, family,, not, friends,, not, even, my, girlfriend, (i, still, love, her,, its, complicated, and, i, dont, have, the, words, to, describe, it).]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |(262144,[0,1,2,3,4,5,11,13,14,15,16,17,24,26,28,30,32,33,34,35,38,40,52,55,71,72,74,92,101,112,114,116,118,130,133,134,136,149,156,165,176,178,186,222,278,289,291,365,375,411,457,486,591,781,813,845,912,1057,1179,1450,1678,1775,1876,1949,2251,2450,2512,3595,3961,4443,5214,5691,14308,18598,41721,198176,231264],[5.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0])                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n",

About 3 years ago  losing my aunt triggered it all. Everyday feeling hopeless , lost, guilty, and remorseful over her and all the things I’ve done in my life,but thoughts like these with the little I’ve experienced in life? Only time I’ve revealed these feelings to my family is when I broke down where they saw my cuts. Watching them get so worried over something I portrayed as an average day made me feel absolutely dreadful. They later found out I was an attempt survivor from attempt OD(overdose from pills) and attempt hanging. All that happened was a blackout from the pills and I never went through with the noose because I’m still so afraid. During my first therapy I was diagnosed with severe depression, social anxiety, and a eating disorder.\\nI was later transferred to a fucken group therapy for some reason which made me feel more anxious. Eventually before my last session with a 1 on 1 therapy she showed me my results from a daily check up on my feelings(which was a 2 - step survey for me and my mom/dad )\\nCome to find out as I’ve been putting feeling horrible and afraid/anxious everyday , my mom has been doing I’ve been doing absolutely amazing with me described as “happiest she’s ever seen me, therapy has helped him” \\nI eventually was put on Sertaline (anti anxiety or anti depression I’m sorry I forgot) but I never finished my first prescription nor ever found the right type of anti depressant because my mom thought I only wanted the drugs so she took me off my recommended pill schedule after ~3 week and stopped me from taking them. All this time I’ve been feeling worse afraid of the damage/ worry I’ve caused them even more. \\nNow here with everything going on, I’m as afraid as I’ve ever been . I’ve relapsed on cutting and have developed severe insomnia . Day after day feeling more hopeless, worthless questioning why am I still here? What’s my motivation to move out of bed and keep going?

I don’t know how to communicate with people anymore and I don’t know how to keep a relationship. I used to be one of the “popular kids” but after my dad passed away I feel into a deep dark hole. I’ve been arrested numerous times, been in rehab, mental hospitals, you name it. The only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my mom and brothers. If I didn’t have them I’d be dead long ago. But it’s getting to the point where even their love and support isn’t going to be enough to keep me alive anymore. I’m either going to be the guy who killed himself, or the guy who went bald and 20 and looks like a child molestor. Which one would you choose?', 'class': 'suicide'}\n",
